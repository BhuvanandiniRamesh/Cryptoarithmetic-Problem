# Cryptoarithmetic-Problem
A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical exercise where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters (or symbols). Each letter represents a unique digit. 
The goal is to find the digits such that a given mathematical equation is verified.

Modeling the problem:
As with any optimization problem, we'll start by identifying variables and constraints. The variables are the letters, which can take on any single digit value.
Each letter shall be assigned a unique base-10 digit. The solution is without leading zeros. The letters should be found by solving the following equation:
OPTI 

+ ML 

+ AI 

+ NP 

= LOVE 

You can solve cryptarithmetic problems with either the new CP-SAT solver, which is more efficient, or the original CP solver. Here the solution is based on CP-SAT.
